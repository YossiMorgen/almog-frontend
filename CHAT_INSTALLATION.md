// Installation instructions for required dependencies

/\*
To install the required dependencies for this Angular chat component, run:

npm install socket.io-client

If you're using Angular 17+ with standalone components, you might also need:

npm install @angular/common @angular/forms

The chat component uses:

- socket.io-client for WebSocket communication
- RxJS for reactive programming (already included with Angular)
- Angular Forms for input handling
- Angular Common for basic directives

Make sure your Angular project is configured to use standalone components.
